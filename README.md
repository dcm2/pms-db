# pms-db

How do I run this ?

1. Get the zip file from ugla or github.
2. Set the project in eclipse (import the zip file as a Maven Project)
3. Download MySQL and create a db with name: pms, username: team20 and password: softproject1. Use port 3306 in the configuration. Other names, password and ports can be use if that is more convenient, but then the aplication.properties file has to be modified accordingly.
4. Run the project. If you see the message 'okay, all set for now' everything went well and now you have the REST API working properly, and a bunch of information (such us some predefined users and playlists) already loaded into the database. You can use those to test the app.
