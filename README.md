# pms-db

How do I run this?

1. Get the zip file from Ugla or Github.
2. Set the project up in Eclipse (import the zip file as a Maven Project)
3. Download MySQL and create a database with name: pms, username: team20 and password: softproject1. Use port 3306 in the configuration. Other names, passwords and ports can be used if that is more convenient, but then the application.properties file has to be modified accordingly.
4. Run the project. If you see the message 'okay, all set for now' in the Console everything went well and now you have the REST API working properly. Information (such as some predefined users and playlists) are already loaded into the database. You can use those to test the app.
